# Low-Resolution Spectral Templates from Gaia DR3

Welcome to this repository, a comprehensive collection of low-resolution spectral templates derived from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). The templates presented here are the culmination of rigorous research and analysis, designed to aid the astronomical community in their stellar classification endeavors and other related tasks.


## Background:
Spectral typing has been a linchpin in astrophysical research, providing invaluable insights into the intrinsic properties of stars. With the advent of the Gaia mission, we have been presented with a treasure trove of data, which when synergized with existing datasets, can offer unprecedented clarity and depth. This project sought to harness the rich data from Gaia DR3, marrying it with the established benchmarks from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to forge a novel set of low-resolution spectral templates.
