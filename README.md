# Low-Resolution Spectral Templates from Gaia DR3

Welcome to this repository, which offers an extensive collection of low-resolution spectral templates derived from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). These templates are the result of meticulous research, encompassing a sample of 37,945 stellar spectra after filtering. Specifically, in range of 3,360 - 10,200 Angstroms, the collection includes templates for main-sequence stars across the OBAFGKM spectrum, each with subcategories from 0 to 9. Additionally, templates for white dwarfs (ranging from DA0.5 to DA7.0) and carbon stars (including dCG, dCK, and dCM types) are provided in the same wavelength range. Designed with precision and depth, these templates are aimed at supporting the astronomical community in their stellar classification endeavors, ensuring both accuracy and comprehensiveness in spectral analyses and related tasks.

## Background:
Spectral typing has been a linchpin in astrophysical research, providing invaluable insights into the intrinsic properties of stars. With the advent of the Gaia mission, we have been presented with a treasure trove of data, which when synergized with existing datasets, can offer unprecedented clarity and depth. This project sought to harness the rich data from Gaia DR3, marrying it with the established benchmarks from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to forge a novel set of low-resolution spectral templates.

## Repository Contents:
1. Spectral Templates: A set of spectral templates spanning a diverse range of stellar types.
2. Python Scripts: Comprehensive scripts detailing the methodologies employed in the creation of these templates, from data extraction and preprocessing to the final template generation. These scripts serve as both a testament to the rigor of the research and as a guide for those wishing to delve deeper or adapt the methods for their purposes.
3. Documentation: Supplementary notes and data files to aid users in understanding the context and sample base of the spectra.

### Figure: Stellar profiles and indicative spectra. On the left, the HR diagram is presented post-outlier exclusion. To the right, exemplary spectra for each primary spectral category (OBAFGKM) are shown. A consistent color scheme links both subplots to the spectral classes, complemented by a unified color reference on the right. These spectra display the unique absorption patterns inherent to each category, underscoring the foundation of their respective classifications.
